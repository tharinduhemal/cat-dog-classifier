# cat-dog-classifier
A simple image classifier that distinguishes between cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Trained on a labeled dataset, with code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and inference
This project is a simple Cat vs Dog image classifier built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It takes an image as input and predicts whether it is a cat or a dog. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and includes code for training, evaluation, and making predictions on new images.
